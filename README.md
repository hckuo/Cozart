# Cozart: Mozart for OS Kernel Configuration

[SIGMETRICS'20] Set the Configuration for the Heart of the OS:
On the Practicality of Operating System Kernel Debloating [[pdf]](https://hckuo.github.io/pdfs/cozart.pdf)

## What's the problem?


We find that less than 20% of an Ubuntu kernel is used for running a HTTP
server. Lots of modules(features) are not used and they can be disabled by
configurations. However, Linux has so many options and the number of options
is still growing... Since it is not practical to spend hours to reconfigure
the kernel every time we deploying an application, we need an automatic tool
that specialize the bloated kernels.

| Version  | # Options  |
|:--------:| -------------:|
| 3.0      |    __11,328__    |
| 4.0      |    __14,406__    |
| 5.0      |    __16,527__    |

## What can Cozart do?

Cozart generates *APPLETS* for each applications and *BASELETS* for each deployment
environment. Cozart then can compose one BASELET and one or multiple APPLETS to
generate the final configuration.


## How can I use Cozart?

```
source constants.sh
make setup-qemu # patch the qemu to enable PC tracing
make setup-linux # clone the linux source
make build-db # parse the linux source to extract the relationships between the configuration options and code
make build-base # build the vanilla kernel as the baseline
make debootstrap # create a rootfs for the VM
./trace-kernel.sh [program in the guest] # trace the workload and generate the configuration 
```
